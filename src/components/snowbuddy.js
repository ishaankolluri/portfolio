            When I moved from California to New York, the first thing I did was buy blizzard-grade winter clothing.
            At the first signs of winter, I proudly walked outside in my new gear, and everyone promptly ridiculed me for it.
            I'm definitely still not used to winter weather, so when given the opportunity to design a responsive website for an emergency response peer economy, 
            I was somewhat amused when our research took us in the direction of snow. Snowbuddy is inspired by my experience living in a New York City apartment, 
            and having to shovel the street outside my stoop after a particularly nasty snowfall. I've been stuck downtown because roads were closed, and have no idea how to salt a sidewalk.

          <div className="a-head">Our project:</div>
          <p className="body">Our goal was to design a responsive website to <b>connect people in times of emergency</b>. 
          We purposefully kept the definition looseâ€”we didn't want to begin designing a solution before figuring out our user needs.
          Our timeline went as follows:

            Our first exercise was to better understand the types of emergencies out there in a systematic fashion, we drew up a small map of the trajectories we were interested in. 
            None of us were familiar with a software-driven solution to emergencies, so we decided to put ink to paper first.

              We wanted to create a way for neighbors to help each other during emergencies. However, the three of us haven't been through all conceivable emergencies in the world. 
              We took to the streets of Pittsburgh to poll our surroundings, asking them about past emergency experiences, what's bothered them the most, and what they wish had happened before and after the event. 
            </p>
            <p className="body-left">
              Our primary takeaway was that <b>it was really unlikely people would be willing to help each other during an actual emergency.</b> Some insights we received were:

              <li className="bullet">"The things I need help with after an emergency are generally tasks I don't have the strength or experience to accomplish."</li>

              After consolidating the results of 10-12 guerrilla interviews, we crafted a series of <b>user scenarios </b>
              focused on creating a peer economy for individuals to help each other with emergencies. 
              We tested these scenarios with a variety of individuals to see whether any of them resonated with a majority. 
              We asked young students, strangers with children, teachers, and the elderly. 
              After discussing our feedback to the litany of emergency situations we created scenarios for, we decided to scope our solution: 
            </p>
            <p className="body">
              <b>A peer economy for neighbors to help each other in snow-related emergencies. More specifically, helping people shovel driveways, 
              salt roads, and break ice, so they may get on with their day.</b>

        </Row>
        <Row>
          <p className="body">
            After tentatively choosing our solution, we crafted 2 personas that we felt represented our solution's user base.
